# memory

- page vs blocks?
- inclusion rule: block in L1 is also in L2



interleaving memeory into different banks.

## principle of locality

Temporal/Spatial locallity

cacheing is always predicting



## block

smallest element for caching



## cahce

address

dirty mark(used on write back)



# unified cache vs split cache

unified: cheaper, balance load/fetch

split: paralel load, higher efficiency for instruction load.
