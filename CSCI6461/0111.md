## RISC vs CISC

complex with simplified instruction set

Risc

- simple ins
- fix length
- uniform decode
- few addressing mode

CISC

- complex ins
- variable length
- non-uniform decode
- many addr mode



## Single cycle machine vs Multi-cycle

Each instruction takes a single clock cycle

  All state updates made at the end of an instruction’s execution 

 Big disadvantage: The slowest instruction determines cycle time 

 long clock cycle time



Multi:

- Instruction processing broken into multiple cycles/stages 
-  State updates can be made during an instruction’s execution  
- Architectural state updates made only at the end of an instruction’s execution  
- Advantage over single-cycle: The slowest “stage” determines cycle time  
- Both single-cycle and multi-cycle machines literally follow the von Neumann model at the microarchitecture level
