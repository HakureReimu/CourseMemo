Hi Seas and ISO officer,



I'm very excited that I've been offered software development engineer (SED) intern employment at Amazon. 

During this intern, my key responsibilities will be

- Collaborate with experienced cross-disciplinary Amazon engineers to conceive, design, and bring innovative products and services to market.
- Design and build innovative technologies in a large distributed computing environment, and help lead fundamental changes in the industry.
- Create solutions to run predictions on distributed systems with exposure to innovative technologies at incredible scale and speed.
- Build distributed storage, index, and query systems that are scalable, fault-tolerant, low cost, and easy to manage/use.
- Ability to design and code the right solutions starting with broadly defined problems.
- Work in an agile environment to deliver high-quality software.

As Amazon is a strong leader in computer science industry, I consider this training offer is directly related to my major field of study, Which is Computer Science. I believe this training will be a very good opportunity to  push my computer science related skills to a new level.



Thanks,
