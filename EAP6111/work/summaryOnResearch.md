# Writing Research Article Introductions in Software Engineering

L. Anthony, “Writing research article introductions in software engineering: How accurate is a standard model?,” IEEE Trans. Prof. Commun., vol. 42, no. 1, pp. 38–46, 1999.



​	This paper mainly described the CARS structure of research article introductions and how this structure is applied to 12 "Best paper" awarded articles in the field of software engineering and the limitation of CARS model.

​	The paper firstly introduced that CARS model, which concepted in 1981, has been considered a strong description of text structure since then. And, The CARS model's moves, which is establishing a territory, establishing a niche and occupying the niche are being described. With these moves known, the paper verified these moves with certain kinds of papers. And brought up a modified CARS model which fits all articles better.

​	In conclusion, the paper concluded that the CARS models is accurately accounted for the writing of introduction in overall framework level. While some important features such as classification of definitions and examples were missing, which is the limitation of CARS model.
