​    Both academic and informal writing played a part in graduate students’ life, but the appropriate choice depends on the audience and context. In order to impress the audience and fit most of the context, these two types of writing differs in target audience, tone and vocabulary.

​    As for the target audience. Academic writing is targeting people such as professor, investor or co-workers. Who already shares common background as the author and wishes to gain academic knowledge through the author’s work. So in this type of writing, the author will goes straight to the point rather than go into detail on the background knowledge. However, Informal writing is for common people, or friends and relatives. They do not share common background as the author does. And this situation requires the author to introduce the background to his reader, or the readers won’t be able to follow the author’s lead.

​    In order to impress these two type of audience, academic and informal writing also differs in tones. When writing in the form of informal writing, the author can use a lot of personal view and emotional description. Which may impress their audience. But for academic wiring, on the other hand, the typical audience wish to see the fact and result rather than the author’s emotion activity or feelings. So these tone of personal view or feeling, which would hinder the authority of the author, is rarely seen in academic writing.

​     When talking about the choice of vocabulary, informal writing is targeting the normal people. Who would like to read casual text and not to think too hard about it. To cope with this, daily words are more likely to be chosen by the author. But for academic writing, the author needs to impress their audience. Who will not take the work seriously if it only contains casual words and informal writing. So they are not a good choice in academic writing.

​    As academic and informal writing differs in these criteria. A capable graduate student should put effort to develop the skill for each of them. Only in this way, they can proceed further in their writing and be able to impress all kind of audiences.
