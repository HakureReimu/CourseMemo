"We are living through the tech enabled unraveling of full-time employment itself", said anthropologist Mary L. Gray(2020) In this TED talk. She suggests that structural changes are being spotted during the COVID-19 pandemic as more business are hiring people on the internet to pick up the on-demand tasks, and these people are called "digital workers".

According to Mary, while these digital workers have played a as essential part as the traditional workers, their benefits are often ignored. And these benefits, like health insurance, have become more important during the pandemic. To make this even worse, Mary found in her study that digital workers often lack achievement and can't control their own schedule, along with many other issues.

In the presence of these problems, Mary claims that a new social contract and safety net need to be formed for these workers. She also mentioned one possible way that company could help these digital workers by exemplifying the development of Amara, originated from a TED translating group. Where people starts translating voluntarily, and get paid afterward.
