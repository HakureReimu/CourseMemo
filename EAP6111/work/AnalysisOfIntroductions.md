Analysis of introductions



​	The introduction part of research articles in computer science area often applies to CARS model, a typical model used to develop highly readable research article introductions. But how good is the CARS model? In this passage, two research articles would be examined and their structure will be identified by the CARS model.

​	First research article will be examined is the Graph-Regularized Locality-Constrained Joint Dictionary and Residual Learning for Face Sketch Synthesis by Junjun Jiang et al[1].  In the introduction part of this research article, The first two paragraphs are perfectly aligned with the Move 1 in CARS model, which is establishing a territory. In this territory, Face sketch synthesis is introduced and historical approaches are described. Then the more modernized method, the learning-based face sketch synthesis approaches are introduced. This part is exactly the Step 1-1 and 1-2 described in the CARS model, which is claiming centrality and making topic generalization. And then, several viable approach of learning-based face sketch synthesis approaches is described and examined. This matches the step 1-3 -- "Reviewing items of pervious research".

​	Then, starting with the word "However", The third paragraph of the introduction explained limitation and challenge of pervious research. This move can be precisely matched to the move 2 of the CARS model, which is "Establishing a niche".

​	After that, the novel face sketch synthesis framework, the main topic of the research article, is presented. And it's unique advantages are discussed. This fits the move 3 part of the CARS model, which is "occupying the niche". And in the end, the structure of the research article is described. Appling the step 3-4 in CARS model --"Indicating RA structure"

​	The second research article to test the CARS model is In-memory BLU acceleration in IBM's DB2 and dashDB: Optimized for modern workloads and hardware architectures presented by Ronald Barber et al [2]. In this research article, the first two paragraph of the introduction part introduced the history and developments of database management system(DBMS) along with their attempts of using DRAM to improve performance. This part is exactly the Move 1 in CARS model, which is "Establishing a territory"

​	And the third paragraph, also starting with the word "However", brought out common problems of existing optimization method. Featuring the gap between the system's initial design and the real world condition of modern enterprises. Then, this gap is exemplified in the fourth paragraph with the problematic performance of a basic database model in several real world situations . This part played the role of move 2 in CARS model, which is "Establishing a niche".

​	The last paragraph firstly concluded the problems needed to be fixed for the previous solution, and the main topic of this research article, the BLU Acceleration analytics engine is introduced. In the end, the structure of other parts of the research article is also described. So this part matches the move 3 of the CARS model well. Starting with the step 3-1A "outlining purpose" and then 3-1B "Announcing present research". Followed by step 3-4 "indicating RA structure".

​	So with two introductions of computer science based research article examined. With all the main moves and most of the sub-moves from CARS model found in both articles, The finding is quiet clear that the CARS model applies to these research articles in high accuracy.
