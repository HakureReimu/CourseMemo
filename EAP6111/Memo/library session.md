   2. [IEEE/IEE Electronic Library](http://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://www.ieee.org/ieeexplore/)

2.  Use one of those databases to search for scholarly articles. Be sure to use OR between synonyms, AND between different aspects of your topic, and limit to scholarly peer reviewed articles within the most recent 5 years. Share your strategy below. Example: (weather forecasting OR weather modelling) AND (machine learning OR neural networks) 

   1. Showing **1-25** of **1,085** for **("All Metadata":"database" OR "All Metadata":"datasystem") AND ("All Metadata":"optimization" OR "All Metadata":"development")**

       **Filters Applied:** Journals,2016 - 2022

3.  Using APA Citation Style (7 th edition), list one citation of an article you found below. **Make sure the article is scholarly, available in full-text, and has references at the end.

   2. b. Copy/Paste the article title into Google Scholar 
   3. c. Request a copy of the article through interlibrary loan 
   4. ==d. All of the above==

5. From the end of the article you chose for #3, select one article from the list of references at the end. List that article below in APA format. 

   1. Liu Ping, Yu Haifeng and Ma Guoqing, "An Incident Response Decision Support System Based on CBR and Ontology", *Proc. Of 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010)*, 22â€“24 October, 2010.

6. Paste that article title into Google Scholar, and list below how many times this article is cited.
