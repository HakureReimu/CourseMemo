  - Good morning everyone and thanks you for clicking into my video, My name is zhang ruojia and you can call me Roger.
  - I'm a new graduate computer science student at GWU and Every thing here seemed new to me. Washington DC is a beautiful city, I had some great food here and I enjoyed staying here.
    I'm from Beijing, the capital city of China. Before My arrival at DC, I've been working as a data engineer for 6 years. I'm a golang coder and I've been working on projects with petabytes of data and a cluster of over 1000 servers to process and store the data. It's a quite challenging job, Every step in the data pipeline must be carefully dealt with. And I learned a lot from that.
    In my free time, I enjoyed computer games and road trips. I'm also a mountain climber, I've Climbed to the top of Mount Fuji in 2018. And to the bottom of grand canyon in 2015.
    As a new graduate student, I'm hoping to gain knowledge that would help me to proceed futher in data science area.
    Thank you all for your time and have a nice day.
