# method

​	This study aimed to find common rhetorical structure in introduction section of research papers in the field of computer science, data engineering. The material used in the study spanned over introduction section of 10 different database related research articles which are published in IEEE journal and several conference journal in the past 20 years. The source country of these research articles varies, like United States, China, India etc... These articles are gathered on internet through Google Scholar, Using the filter 2004-2021 with keyword database. Prioritized with the number of times which the research articles is being cited by others. All the papers validated that are peer-reviewed and are in a traditional IMRD structure to increase the validation of results and remove the influence of unexpected non-IMRD structured research articles.

​	The model used in this study is CARS model, a well established rhetorical model for analyzing introductions in computer science area, by Swales(1990). This model categorized the basic moves of introduction section into 3 main parts: move1-Establishing a research territory, move2-Establishing a niche and move3-Occupying the niche. The first step in this study is to use the CARS model to identify the language composition of the introduction sections in the selected research articles. The correspondence part of each move in each sample research article are being matched with the CARS model by the signal words and the language patterns. The missing moves are also being recorded. And secondly, the sequences of each move are being collected and recorded into a table. 

​	  Although the number of samples are just few compared with the papers in the whole data area in computer science. The aim of this study could still be achieved. But more research articles being analyzed may help to validate the result and promote the finding to a higher, more universal level.

​	The data collected in the previous steps are being recorded into two tables and will be analyzed in the following result section.
