The substances's molecules are in continual motion and, by this motion, possess kinetic energy which produces heat.
-The average kinetic energy of the molecules are measured by temperature. 
+Heat, or temperature could determine the molecules's average kinetic energy.
-Cooling to the point at which molecular movement ceases completely should thus be possible.
+And the molecular movement could possibly be ceased completely by cooling to a point.
-Scientists are very interested in this point, absolute zero, but it is in practice unattainable. 
+But this point, which draws mamy interest from the scientists, is in practice unattainable and is called absolute zero.
