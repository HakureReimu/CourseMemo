- Explain two of the guidelines you felt the most important or you would prioritize for your VR project.
  - 1: Multidimensional output: e.g. Audio( voice over) guidance
  - 2: Avoid adverse health effect, if the player feels sick when playing, then it's not a good game.
- What have you done in your project related to any of these human-centered VR design concepts?
  - We are planning to implement voice over guidance during the whole gameplay for Multidimensional output.
  - We use teleport as locomotion method to avoid possible adverse health effect to the player.







1. What are the three new concepts you learned in the context of VR application development?
2. Explain at least one of these concepts to your group members.
3. Listen everyone else's selection of concepts.
4. Individually submit your answer (three novel concepts) explaining why they are important for VR. 



- visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM)
  - This concept enables VR location tracking with out outside trackers/signals.
- User movement prediction
  - This novel method will help to reduce the latency of input. Helping to build better VR experience.
- ultraefficient, device-optimized CV
  - This method enables wireless VR headset, which could run several hours on it's internal battery.
