| Avoid screen space effects when you can                      | No screen space effect                                       |
| Aim for a frame rate slightly higher than the target display frame rate | frame rate is ok                                             |
| Consider lowering the rendered resolution if the frame rate needs to be increased | frame rate is ok                                             |
| The player’s head motions should be in control of the camera at all times. Avoid using cinematic cameras, and try to use asynchronous loading in menus or during level loads. Avoid camera shake and other effects that move the camera without the user’s control. | No cinematic cameras are spotted                             |
| Do not override the field of view of the player’s view       | FOV does change in the motion, this causes intense motion sickness |
| Avoid accelerations                                          | Some sort of accel as it's the main part of the game, and this doesn't feels good |
