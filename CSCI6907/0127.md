•What is the novel aspect of their approach?

we continuously support users’ navigation with WIM views, not only at info points, by transitioning within Mixed Reality (MR) between Virtual Reality (VR) and AR (Figure 1)

•What are the key requirements for indoor navigation system and what are the possible solutions?

requirements : location of user, indoor map

- step-by-step instructions(assume user is on right route)
- info points
- phone to scan indoor map

•Which mobile device sensors were utilized and how?

- phone sensor: tilting the angle of display, approx location of user

- phone camera: identify the info point

- provide brief step by step instructions to the user.

- Tell user they went the wrong way if wrong info points are dectected.
- Provide the route to get back to the correct route.
