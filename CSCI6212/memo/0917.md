- insert
  - search for a, if not exist, create the node containing a
  - see search and insert example 
    - constant time in searching
  - delete pointer, attach the child to parent.
  - pick largest value(rightmost) in each brach,use that node as the deleted
    - make left child to the previous parent

- delete
  - see complete slide
- use hash for maps

## Heap

- delete-min
- insert
- useage
  - priority queue
  - first-priority, first serve
- almost complete binary treeï¼Ÿ
- child must be larger than parent.
  - swap child and parent if not
  - become valid, or child become the root
- logN level
- why NlogN? no, only logN
- Heap imagined as tree, practised as array



## Union find Data structure

- every child has a parent.
- construct an arrry of index(element number) and it's own parent. use number to find which set it is in.
- single tree is the worst case in union find with only one array.
- path compression, as a find, make every node in the path to point directly to the parent.
