- insert
  - search for a, if not exist, create the node containing a
  - see search and insert example 
    - constant time in searching
  - delete pointer, attach the child to parent.
  - pick largest value(rightmost) in each brach,use that node as the deleted
    - make left child to the previous parent

- delete
  - see complete slide
- use hash for maps

## Heap

- delete-min
- insert
- useage
  - priority queue
  - first-priority, first serve
- almost complete binary tree？
- child must be larger than parent.
  - swap child and parent if not
  - become valid, or child become the root
- logN level
- why NlogN? no, only logN
- Heap imagined as tree, practised as array



## Union find Data structure

- every child has a parent.
- construct an arrry of index(element number) and it's own parent. use number to find which set it is in.
- single tree is the worst case in union find with only one array.
- path compression, as a find, make every node in the path to point directly to the parent.

## Proof Induction

prove basic(f(0)=x)

prove induction step, assume f(n) is true, prove f(n+1) based on that

proved

## LRR（liner recurrence relation） of order 1(the x~n~ depends on x~n-1~)

𝑥~n~ = 𝐴a^n^ + sp.x~n~ 

x~n~=ax~n-1~+b

solve b,A using x~n~,x~n-1~



x~n~=2x~n-1~+2^n^, x~0~=0

a=2，b=2^n^

sp.x~n~=c2^n^+d

 𝐴2^n^+c2^n^+d=2(𝐴2^n-1^+c2^n-1^+d)+2^n^= 𝐴2^n^+c2^n^+2d+2^n^

d=-2^n^

d is not constant. not working

use sp.x~n~ = (cn+d)2^n^+e

 𝐴2^n^+ (cn+d)2^n^+e =2(𝐴2^n-1^+ (cn-c+d)2^n-1^+e)+2^n^

A+cn+d=A+cn-c+d+1

e=2e,e=0

c=1
