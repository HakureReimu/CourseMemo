# DFS and BFS

- Inorder traversal on binary search tree will get sorted list.

- DFS
  - get smallest neighbour and visit
  - goback if no unvisited neighbour
  - finish visiting
  - use the stack to record the path
- BFS
  - get all unvisited nodes
  - insert into queue
  - dequeue, visit and do again

- in single weighted graph
  - The BFS paths from the root to all the nodes are shortest paths
- Biconnectivity
  - AP: delete the point will disconnect
  - Biconnected: no ap exist
  - every pair of node x and y in G there is two disjointed path
- BIconnectivity Problem
  - input G
  - output if bicoonected or not, find the AP
- x is an articulation point iff x has a child 𝑤𝑤 whereL[w] ≥ 𝐷FN[x]
