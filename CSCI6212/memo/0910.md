## Data Structure

- array
- table
- list
- tree
- etc

## action

- insert
- delete
- maximum

## design

When do we actually need a data structure

improve the efficiency of algorithm that would do basic operation on something over and over again, like 100 million times.



### stack

- push(insert)
- pop(delete)
- top(return top)

## Linked list

how to delete?

- prev.next = now.next,

- delete now

- single linked list: only next
- double linked list: next and previous

## Graph

- directed
- undirected
