## average-case analysis of quicksort

TA(n)=2sum(T(1)+.,,.....T(n)/n



# check on selection sort

get k^th^ largest element recursively



quick select

divide and councur

parition first(left of index is smaller than index, right is bigger, achieved by j go through the array,swap i,j if a[j]>a[index],i++)

if k>l(go to right part),k=k-l

if k =l return

if k<l(go to left part)

Induction hypothesis

T(n)=20nc



## homework

check on polymor D&C method

T(n)=O(n)(O(n^2^ originaly))

check on DFT
