# branch and bound

- job assignment problem
  - the C-> predictor
  - use the cost so far?
  - second C->cost so far + minimum in the future rows.
  - third c-> cost so far + minimum in the future non-picked rows.



# Lower bound

- lower bound for any problem P is a speed barrier
- output size is always lower bound
- size of input is a lower bound if no structure.



# NP

- imaginary choose

- verification stage
