# Data selection/curation

overfitting problem

stop overfitting:

- more data
- stop model early
- Consider a weaker model that is less capable of memorizing your data

under fitting:

- more powerful model



# bias vs variance

how to measure??

- 

variance:

- add more data?
- 



Bias:

- maybe wrong model?
- 

trade off:

- 

# improving model

- fix errors?
- 

# cross validation(CV)

- auto_adjust the validation /holdout
- draw error rates to determine

# precision, recall, f1-score

precision: how many of the claim
