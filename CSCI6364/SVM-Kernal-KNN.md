# NN trade off

- expressive than linear model

- expensive(data, price, gpu)



## support vectore machines

- split and makes the largest margin

- support vectors
  - the dots that decide the line.
  - use mehod(kernal intuition to map data into linear
- popular before NN
  - finding best kernal functions could be tough, and manually

## KNN 

- another classification model
- k nearest neighbours

## decision tree vs k-nn
