Classification: Practical issues -- Dataset Engineering

# limited sample:?

- get more data
- train on larger dataset and transfer learning to current model
- don't split sample from same object from training to handout
- 



# Decision tree don't do well with lots of features.

- remove one of highly correlated value.
- fix missing values
- Clean the dataset!!!
- Convert data to numeric representations.
- convert values with no scaling to just y
